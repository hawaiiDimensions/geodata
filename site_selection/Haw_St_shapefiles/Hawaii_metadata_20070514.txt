  Description:
    Abstract: This digital publication contains all the geologic map information used to publish U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Investigations Map Series I-XXXX (Sherrod and others, 2008).  This geologic map shows the distribution and stratigraphic relation of volcanic, intrusive, and sedimentary units emplaced in the past 8 million years across the eight principal islands of the Hawaiian archipelago, State of Hawaii, U.S.A.
    Purpose:  This database was constructed in order to assess volcano and earthquake hazards and ground-water distribution in the State of Hawaii.

  Use_Constraints:  Uses of this digital geologic map should not violate the spatial resolution of the data.  Although the digital form of the data removes the constraint imposed by the scale of a paper map, the detail and accuracy inherent in map scale are also present in the digital data.  This map was compiled and edited for scale 1:100,000, so no higher-resolution information is present in the dataset.  Plotting at scales larger than 1:100,000 will not yield greater real detail, although it may reveal fine-scale irregularities below the intended resolution of the database.  Similarly, where this database is used in combination with other data of higher resolution, the resolution of the combined output will be limited by the lower resolution of these data.  Acknowledgment of the U.S. Geological Survey would be appreciated in products derived from these data.  There are no expressed warranties associated with the release of this database.  Specifically, no warranty is made that the GIS data or any subsequent updates will be error free, and no warranty is made regarding the positional or thematic accuracy of the GIS data.  The GIS data and any features they depict do not represent or confer any legal rights, privileges, benefits, boundaries, or claims of any kind.  The U.S. Geological Survey encourages GIS data users to verify the suitability of the data before use.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Good.  Feature attributes were entered by Sarah E. Watkins and David R. Sherrod, reviewed by Donald A. Swanson and Edward M. Wolfe, then later checked by USGS Geologic Map Editor __________ and USGS senior author Sherrod.  The attributes consist of text identifiers and numeric codes for each geologic unit or type of geologic feature, and they determine how each feature is colored or symbolized.  For purposes of checking attribute accuracy, a color plot was visually compared to the geologists' original compilation.  Discrepancies between the digital geospatial dataset and the original analog compilation were corrected as needed.  Machine-created listings of unique attribute values were used to identify spelling errors or other inconsistencies, and corrections were made as needed.
    Quantitative_Attribute_Accuracy_Assessment:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Value:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Explanation:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Polygon and arc (chain-node) topology present in MapInfo coverages.  Other coverages are point or annotation; neither they nor any supplied raster images require topologic relations.  Polygon coverages were tested topologically using Mapinfo software, with no errors found for duplicate nodes, overlaps, or gaps.
  Completeness_Report:  This dataset is intended to describe completely the igneous and sedimentary products and structural features at 1:100,000 scale.  Omitted in most places are those features whose visual resolution requires a substantially larger scale of presentation.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:  Geologic source data were compiled electronically from source maps, some of which were produced originally on topographic base maps published in the 1920s.  These data were fitted to modern topography using 7.5-minute topographic digital raster graphs from the 1980s, with exception of Island of Hawaii, the data for which were provided in electronic format.  Consequently, data have a horizontal positional accuracy corresponding to 1 mm at the scale of the intermediate-scale map, or ranging from plus-or-minus 15 to 50 meters on the ground.  An overall accuracy is reported here as within 100 meters on the ground.  Inaccuracies associated with the 7.5-minute topographic maps themselves, which are within National Map Accuracy Standards, will be far less than the stated accuracy of the 100,000-scale geologic map.
      Quantitative_Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Assessment:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Value:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Explanation:
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: No vertical positional data recorded in polygon or arc (chain-node) coverages. Databases for geochemical and radiometric samples report orthometric altitude, which was estimated by inspection of plotted points on digital raster graphs of 1:24,000-scale topographic quadrangles. Accuracy is no better than one-half the contour interval, which ranges from 10 to 40 ft.
